# How to - theme edition & creation

## Themes
All themes must be moved to this directory to be used by System Monitor.  
A theme consist of its own folder, with its resources (bitmaps) and a `theme.yaml` file

Note: other PNG files in this folder that do not have their own respective theme folder are only examples.  
They cannot be used as themes because their `theme.yaml` file has not been written yet.  
You can dot it yourself: see below.

## Creation & edition
